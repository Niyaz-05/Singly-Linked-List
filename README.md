# Singly-Linked-List
This Java program demonstrates the implementation of a Singly Linked List data structure. A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes, as they do not require contiguous memory allocation.
